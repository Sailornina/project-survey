# Survey Form with React âœ¨

This Survey is created with components React using different function methods, and inputs like a radio button, checkbox, text, and option. The main goal was to learn how to use UseState Hook.

I feel glad with the result of my work this week. I would like to improve the code in a future because I want to append different answers depending on the user's response and also, that the input checkbox can only choose one or two options.
